out of the frying pan and into the fire
one leg in the door
why the long face?
in the same boat
up a creek without a paddle
raining cats and dogs
feeling under the weather
green with envy
frog in your throat
head over heels in love
a wolf in sheep's clothing
grab the bull by the horns
out of this world
water under the bridge
put your foot in your mouth
bull in a china closet
have a cow
tie the knot
have two left feet
get cold feet
bouncing off the walls
a fifth wheel
kick the bucket
when in Rome
rise above the blues
scared stiff
one smart cookie
caught red-handed
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
a fly on the wall
jump the gun
throw a fit
take a hike
fraidey cat
carry a tune
eat my words
apple of my eye
hit the road
a blessing in disguise
piece of cake
all bark and no bite
when pigs fly
cost an arm and a leg
hold your horses
the whole nine yards
everything but the kitchen sink
close, but no cigar
back to the drawing board
go out on a limb
wake up on the wrong side of the bed
steal my thunder
once in a blue moon
let the cat out of the bag
hit the sack
let bygones be bygones
grab the bull by the horns
dyed-in-the-wool
can't keep a good dog down
make a mountain out of a molehill
pull the wool over your eyes
